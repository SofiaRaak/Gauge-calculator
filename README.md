# Gauge-calculator

Automatic calculator for common knitting gauge calculations

This is just a fun little project to get to grips with the basics of C++. I decided to build a calculator using knitting gauges because it's a headache to figure a lot of the common calculations out on paper when I want to make adapt or make my own patterns.
